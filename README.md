# Create and Mint Token
Creating and minting a token involves deploying a smart contract on a blockchain platform like Ethereum.

## Description
Creating and minting tokens involves gas fees (transaction fees) and requires some familiarity with blockchain development and smart contracts. 

## Getting Started

### Executing the Program

Using Remix IDE, a online development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, execute the provided Solidity smart contract by creating a new file, pasting the code, compiling it using the Solidity Compiler tab, deploying it to a chosen Ethereum network via the Deploy & Run Transactions tab, and subsequently interacting with its functions, allowing us to test and validate the contract's behavior comprehensively.

Code:
